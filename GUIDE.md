## Configuration

`--sys-debug` if set the api will log more verbose information about internal events

`--audit-trace` if set, and tty was requested all keystrokes will be logged (otherwise the async auditer will merge keystrokes into command on each new lines)

`--by-pass-user` repeatable flag for adding users to bypass list so they can use the standard exec command, handy for system users like `system:admin`

`--by-pass-shared-key` this flags needs to be set if one runes more then one replica of rexec api, so the shared key between the apiservice part and the validatingwebhookpart are matching, otherwise said hey is autogenerated, it has to be a RFC 4122 compliant uuid

`--max-strokes-per-line` with this flag we can alter the treshold we have on a linelength before async audit flushes, keep in mind the increasing it too high might lead oom kills on the rexec server
